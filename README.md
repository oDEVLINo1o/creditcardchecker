# Credit Card Checker

For this programme project I created my own code for the Luhn Algorithm which works perfectly.

## Array of numbers 

Originaly the project was to take an input array give a true false output on weather the card was valid or not

- first I took the input array and reversed the order
- I then created 2 for loops 1 for odd array index and 1 for the even array count
- At this point the even index count numbers where multiplied by 2 and if they ended up 2 didget numbers I took away 9
- Each loop was then summed and added together
- If the total could be evenly devided by 10 the card is valid 

## String of numbers

I then modified the algorithm to accept strings this allowed me to make a simple HTML page for user input.
